# Info Bouvet.CV.Service

## Deactivated properties

For some reason these properties have to be ignored, else there will be deserialization errors.
Can not find the reason why there are these errors while deserializing the detailed user objects.

The mentioned properties are not in the schema for the detailed users, only when fetching all users are there these properties.
